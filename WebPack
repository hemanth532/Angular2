Webpack? What is that?

Web development is not what it used to be. In the olden days you would create a script tag, write your javascript 
and that would be it. With the need of highly interactive and rich web applications and the use of modern web 
technologies like TypeScript, SASS or ESnext and new features like ES6 modules we need something that can translate 
our applications into something that can run in any browser.

Thatâ€™s where tools like Webpack step in. Webpack is a module bundler that takes all these files and modules, processes
them and makes them available in a way that can be run in any browser. Moreover it can optimize your application by
taking advantage of a rich community of plugins.
